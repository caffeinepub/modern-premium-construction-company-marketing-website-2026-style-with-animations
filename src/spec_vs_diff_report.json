However, the diff does not provide evidence that the required generated image assets were actually added under the specified public path, and several unrequested additions (notably backend and Internet Identity/actor hooks, plus a promotional footer link) appear in the changes.",

      "reason": "The sections reference image paths under /assets/generated, but the diff summary does not show the actual image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (and some added files were omitted due to limits). Therefore presence of the required static assets cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
