# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page, premium 2026-style construction company marketing website with conversion-focused sections, modern animations, and a charcoal/yellow/white visual theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a cohesive single-page layout with sections: Hero, About, Services, Projects, Why Choose Us, Testimonials, Contact/CTA, and Footer using modern grid spacing, rounded corners, soft shadows, and subtle glassmorphism/gradients.
- Add a sticky transparent navbar that changes style on scroll and provides smooth-scrolling navigation to each section.
- Implement a full-width Hero with the exact headline “Building the Future with Strength & Precision”, subtitle, “Get a Quote” and “View Projects” CTAs, plus subtle parallax and/or fade-in animation.
- Build an About split section with overlapping image treatment and reveal-on-scroll animation.
- Add a responsive Services grid (3–6 cards) with icons, titles, descriptions, and hover lift/shadow micro-interactions.
- Add a Featured Projects masonry/modern grid with hover overlays and a keyboard-accessible lightbox modal with next/previous navigation.
- Add a Why Choose Us icon-based layout with animated statistic counters that trigger once on first viewport entry.
- Add a Testimonials carousel/slider with smooth transitions, controls, and mobile swipe support.
- Add a dark, conversion-focused CTA section with a prominent construction-yellow button.
- Add a minimal modern footer with contact info, quick links, and social icons.
- Apply site-wide reveal-on-scroll animations and hover micro-interactions with performance and accessibility in mind (respect reduced-motion preference).
- Ensure full responsiveness, mobile optimization, strong modern sans-serif typography, clear hierarchy, and accessible interactions.
- Add generated construction imagery as static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` and wire into Hero, About, and Projects.

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can scroll through a premium, responsive construction company landing page with smooth navigation, animated sections, a projects gallery with lightbox viewing, a testimonials slider, and prominent CTAs.
